Tandoori butter roti are unleavened whole wheat flat breads traditionally these are made in a
tandoor,which is a pot-shaped clay oven and not on a skillet or flat pan.
hence the name tandoori roti which means that these are cooked in a tandoor unlike the regular roti
which is cooked on tawa(a flat or concave shaped  skillet)</pre>
